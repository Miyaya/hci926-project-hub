[Official Document](https://syncstate.geekyants.com/docs/getting-started)
> SyncState is a document-based state management library for React and JS apps.
> In a SyncState store, all your data is contained in a single document. SyncState is based on JSON patches and uses these patches to update the document.
> While SyncState can very well be used as a general purpose state management solution, we created it to make it easy to build realtime multi-user, undoable apps.
