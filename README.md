# hci926-project-hub
collaborative project and task management platform

## Execution
### client side
```
npm i
npm run start
```
### server side
```
cd server
node index.js
```

## Some take-away for me
1. Server-side rendered can't handle peer-to-peer collaborative behaviors; client-side rendered can't store data in persistence.

## Reference

### SyncState
[Official Document](https://syncstate.geekyants.com/docs/getting-started)
> SyncState is a document-based state management library for React and JS apps.
> In a SyncState store, all your data is contained in a single document. SyncState is based on JSON patches and uses these patches to update the document.
> While SyncState can very well be used as a general purpose state management solution, we created it to make it easy to build realtime multi-user, undoable apps.
